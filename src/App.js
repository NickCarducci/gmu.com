          "How does supply exceed demand?"
          <br />
          Nick Carducci - policy-drafting software-developer & microeconomist
          <br />
          Supply and demand move up when more currency is introduced, and after
          a lifetime (discounting the importance of inheritance), and to the
          right when more people are introduced. This Supply and Demand plane,
          numerically, is 0y/1x, (-GDP/p)/(GDP/hour), or GDP/hour-GDP/p, when
          labor-demand=supply, or demand is exclusively labor.
          <br />
          <br />
          How might supply exceed demand? Hard to imagine, since anytime labor
          does not equal demand, you can draw a dead weight box, suffocating the
          quality-skew/propensities of Marginal Utility Indifferences of both
          the ask, for their inventory, and the bid, for their currency-fungible
          alternatives.
